This project explores the fastest way of loading large amounts of data into SimpleDB.

You'll need to edit SimpleDBLoader.java to add your own AWS keys and recompile before you can do anything.

# First, cd into this directory in the terminal
# Then run this line to compile the class:
javac -cp lib/amazon-simple-db-2009-04-15-java-library.jar SimpleDBLoader.java

# You should then be able to run the loader class like this:
java -cp lib/amazon-simple-db-2009-04-15-java-library.jar:lib/commons-httpclient-3.0.1.jar:lib/commons-logging-1.1.jar:lib/commons-codec-1.3.jar:. SimpleDBLoader help

Once you've done that, create the domains you'll need by running this script as:
java -cp<...> SimpleDBLoader setup

After that, you can test the data loading speed by passing 'test' as the first argument, followed by an optional number of items (defaults to 10000)
and the number of threads to use (defaults to 100), eg:
java -cp<...> SimpleDBLoader test 10000 100

When you're finished testing, run this command to remove the test domains:
java -cp<...> SimpleDBLoader cleanup
